## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This model helps forecast the availability or demand of taxis around train stations by analyzing factors such as:

- Train schedules and delays  
- Passenger volume  
- Weather conditions  
- Time of day and location-specific trends

### Use Cases:

- Urban mobility planners  
- Ride-hailing platforms  
- Transit authorities  
- Smart city solutions

## ðŸ§  Features

- Predicts taxi availability based on train activity  
- Supports real-time and scheduled predictions  
- Utilizes ML algorithms like scikit-learn / XGBoost  
- Easy to retrain and fine-tune with new data
